# Sudoku solver using a combination of CV, ML, DL and rule based algorithms
Computer vision & machine learning were considered early to solve this problem but DL was more performant, thus chosen. THe whole implmentation was tested on both notebook and RESTful api, so it could be deployed easily.
Interesting points of this hobby projects are:
- Grid detection using semantic segmentation
- Grid processing using computer vision
- Handwritten/editor digits recognition
- Grid solving
- Backtracking of solution in original point of view
